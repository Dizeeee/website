# website
My personal website, built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of the website:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

This website should deploy to Vercel using the default SvelteKit configuration.
